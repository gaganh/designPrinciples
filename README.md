# design-principles

This project's goal is to build a sweet little app to help anyone learn the basic principles of design. The end-product will be a simple flashcard and quiz application to test, restest, and commit to memory-- various principles of design that can be applied accross various disciplines.

## Front-End Stack

HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Angular, Node, Bower, Grunt

## Community Engagement

Once live, members of the community will be able to submit principles to be considered for learning through the application.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
